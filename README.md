# SoftDev4LS Working Group

This working group aims to put in place guidelines to improve the quality and sustainability of software development in life sciences.

The group is organised in three subgroups
* [Good Enough Practices](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/good-enough-practices)
* [Open Source Software](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/open-source-software)
* [Software Development Metrics](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/software-development-metrics)

This working group has so far the commitment and support from [ELIXIR](http://www.elixir-europe.org/) and the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/). It also counts with the participation of members from [ISBE](http://project.isbe.eu/), the [eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), [BBMRI](http://bbmri-eric.eu/) and [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/).

The group welcomes representatives with expertise in software development best practices from umbrella organisations involved in the coordination of bioinformatics services. We also welcome the participation of organisations involved in the promotion software development best practices.
