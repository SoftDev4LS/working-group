# SoftDev4LS Working Group

This working group aims to put in place guidelines to improve the quality and sustainability of software development in life sciences.

The group is organised in three subgroups
* [Good Enough Practices](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/good-enough-practices)
* [Open Source Software](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/open-source-software)
* [Software Development Metrics](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/software-development-metrics)

This working group started as part of an ELXIIR project and so far has been facilitated by [ELIXIR](http://www.elixir-europe.org/), the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/) and the [eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/).

This working group has been facilitated by [ELIXIR](http://www.elixir-europe.org/), the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/) and the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) as part of an [ELIXIR project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hA0c9ASHEF990ksXtXumjcpsLyuPuXFl2mNS61zHdvg/edit?usp=sharing) to increase quality and sustainability of the software developed in life sciences. However the working group has been very inclusive engaging different communities and stakeholders not just representing ELIXIR and life sciences. The group welcomes representatives with expertise in software development best practices from umbrella organisations involved in the coordination of bioinformatics services. We also welcome the participation of organisations involved in the promotion of software development best practices.

If you would like to be part of this group to develop further software best practices and recommendations please add your contact information to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JyFX5q2CQU7gzTuXrHrxKWYthnE9YcNWmu-qtB-nNxc/edit?usp=sharing) to subscribe you to our mailing list and github repository.
