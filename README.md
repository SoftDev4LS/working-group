# SoftDev4LS Working Group

This working group aims to put in place guidelines to improve the quality and sustainability of software development in a scientific environment.

The group is organised in three subgroups
* [Good Enough Practices](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/good-enough-practices)
* [Open Source Software](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/open-source-software)
* [Software Development Metrics](https://github.com/SoftDev4LS/software-development-metrics)

This working group started as part of an [ELIXIR project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hA0c9ASHEF990ksXtXumjcpsLyuPuXFl2mNS61zHdvg/edit?usp=sharing) to increase quality and sustainability of software developed in life sciences. However the working group has been very inclusive engaging different communities and stakeholders not just representing ELIXIR and life sciences. The group welcomes any individuals and organisations who are concerned with the production of quality software for research.

This working group so far has been facilitated by [ELIXIR](http://www.elixir-europe.org/), the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk/) and the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). If you would like to be part of this group to develop further guidelines please add your contact information to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JyFX5q2CQU7gzTuXrHrxKWYthnE9YcNWmu-qtB-nNxc/edit?usp=sharing) to subscribe you to our mailing list and github repository.
